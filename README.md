# Poke Tracker

Poke Tracker is a Python Flask application that allows users to track which Pokemon that they would like to collect in their play-throughs.

## How to install Poke Tracker

Currently you are required to download our main GitHub branch.

First you must run manage.py to initialize the database and then run the app.py file with Flask.

```bash
python manage.py
python app.py
```

## Usage

Once you've started your local server you can create an account and track which Pokemon are missing from your collection.

Pokemon are divided by their Generations and can be filtered by type, or searched for individually to add them to your collection tab, which is stored onto your account.

Additionally, by clicking a Pokemon you may open it's page to get more info about it: such as its stats, moves, types, or where its found.
